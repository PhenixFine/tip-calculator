The app caclulates the tip from a given number and given amount selected from the slider.
## Requirements
### Description
You're almost there! In the final stage of the project, you need to take the user input data and perform the calculations. To determine the tip amount, take the overall bill value, multiply the number by the tip percentage, and divide it by 100. Output the tip amount with two digits in the fraction part.
### Objectives
Using the event listeners from the previous stage, update the tip calculation result in the `TextView` each time the user changes the bill value or tip percentage.
